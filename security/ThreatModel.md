Hello Bob,

I was going through old code and noticed we may have a security problem. ESLint was recently compromised and malicious code was allowed onto our system to log our tokens.

In my opinion we should go through all our past code and make sure we update the packages. we'll also need to perform audits for security purposes. 

P.S. 
    Remember to delete all github tokens
